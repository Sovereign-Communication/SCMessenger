# Design: Trust-Scoped LAN Disclosure for Ledger Exchange

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-08-05
**Author:** Systems Engineering / Cryptography Team
**Component:** `core/src/store/ledger_entry.rs`, `core/src/transport/swarm.rs`
**Protocol:** `/sc/ledger-exchange/1.0.0`

## 1. Threat Model

### Current Protections (NEW-2 / F6)
The current implementation of `exchange_response_entries()` in `core/src/store/ledger_entry.rs:1170` enforces a strict "public-only" disclosure policy. This protects against three specific threat vectors:

1.  **Topology Leakage to Strangers:** Any node completing a Noise handshake is currently treated as a potential ledger exchange partner. Without filtering, a malicious node could map the entire private network topology of a victim simply by connecting to one gateway node.
2.  **SSRF-Adjacent Abuse:** Disclosing RFC1918 addresses to untrusted peers enables Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks where an external attacker uses a compromised or malicious node to probe internal services that are not exposed to the public internet.
3.  **Group-Membership Leakage:** The blanking of `known_topics` prevents inference of private group membership or application-specific context based on topic subscriptions associated with private IPs.

### Risk Delta with RFC1918 Disclosure
Enabling LAN disclosure introduces the following risks which this design must mitigate:

*   **Trust Confusion:** A user may believe they are paired with a trusted device, but if the pairing state is stale or corrupted, LAN details leak to an impersonator.
*   **Relay Amplification:** If a trusted peer acts as a relay, it must *not* forward LAN addresses learned from Node A to Node B unless Node B is also explicitly trusted by Node A. Trust must be end-to-end, not transitive via transport.
*   **Fingerprinting:** Even with trust, disclosing LAN structure allows a compromised trusted device to fingerprint the user's physical location or network setup more precisely than public IP alone.

### Security & Discovery Doctrine
**Friction-Free Local Discovery:** When devices are on the same local network (RFC 1918 / IPv6 ULA), peer discovery and ledger address exchange are open and enabled by default. People on the same LAN must be able to communicate easily without pre-pairing friction.

**WAN Boundary Protection:** Cryptographic pairing proof (`TrustLevel >= Trusted`) is enforced when disclosing private network addresses across remote WAN internet relays, preventing external topology probing while keeping local LAN discovery seamless.

## 2. Gating Mechanism

RFC 1918 entries are included in ledger exchange responses whenever the remote requesting peer is on the SAME RFC 1918 local network domain (`is_same_subnet`) OR possesses a verified paired identity (`TrustLevel >= Trusted`).

### Disclosure Predicate Rules
1. **Same LAN Context (Default Enabled)**: The requesting peer's active connection address or local listener shares the same RFC 1918 / IPv6 ULA subnet class. Discovery is automatic and friction-free.
2. **Paired Contact Context (WAN Access)**: For remote WAN connections, private IP disclosure requires a verified identity with `trust_level >= Trusted` (via signed `LedgerEntry::AnnotateIdentity`).

### Implementation References
*   **Identity Verification:** `core/src/identity/mod.rs::verify_identity_signature()`. Ensures the peer actually owns the claimed NodeID.
*   **Trust State Storage:** `core/src/store/ledger_entry.rs::get_identity_annotation()`. Retrieves the local trust decision.
*   **Predicate Function:** New function `core/src/store/ledger_entry.rs::is_trusted_for_lan_disclosure(peer_id: &PeerId, store: &Store) -> bool`.

### Why Not Allowlists?
While block/allow lists exist, they are often used for connectivity gating rather than data disclosure policy. The `AnnotateIdentity` ledger entry is the canonical source of *relationship semantics* in our doctrine. Using it ensures that trust decisions are replicated and auditable via the ledger itself, rather than hidden in ephemeral configuration.

## 3. Wire Compatibility

### Protocol Strategy
We retain the `/sc/ledger-exchange/1.0.0` protocol identifier. No version bump is required because the change is purely semantic filtering of existing fields, not a schema change.

### Backward Compatibility
*   **Old Node (Sender) -> New Node (Receiver):** Old nodes never send RFC1918. New receivers handle this normally (no regression).
*   **New Node (Sender) -> Old Node (Receiver):** New nodes will filter out RFC1918 for unpaired peers (identical to old behavior). For paired peers, new nodes *will* send RFC1918. Old receivers already possess the parsing logic for these multiaddrs; they were simply never populated previously. Old receivers will accept and store them.
    *   *Note:* This means an old node paired with a new node will suddenly gain LAN awareness. This is acceptable as the old node already had the code path, just not the data. The security boundary is enforced by the *sender*.

### Capability Advertisement
No explicit capability advertisement is needed. The sender makes the disclosure decision unilaterally based on local trust state. The receiver does not need to signal "I can handle LAN IPs" because the protocol spec already defines the field; previous absence was a policy choice, not a limitation.

## 4. API Surface

### `core/src/store/ledger_entry.rs`

#### Modified: `exchange_response_entries()`
*   **Signature Change:** Add `peer_trust_level: TrustLevel` and `requester_addr: Option<&Multiaddr>` parameters.
    ```rust
    pub fn exchange_response_entries(
        &self,
        requester: &PeerId,
        limit: usize,
        peer_trust_level: TrustLevel, // NEW
        requester_addr: Option<&Multiaddr>, // NEW
    ) -> Vec<LedgerEntry>
    ```
*   **Logic Update:** Inside the filter closure at line ~1170:
    ```rust
    if !is_disclosable_multiaddr(&entry.addr) {
        // Private range override REQUIRES trusted identity AND same local RFC1918 network context
        let is_trusted = peer_trust_level >= TrustLevel::Trusted;
        let is_same_network = is_same_rfc1918_network(requester_addr, &entry.addr);

        if !(is_trusted && is_same_network) && entry.addr.is_private() {
            return false;
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Topic Disclosure:** When `peer_trust_level >= Trusted`, cease blanking `known_topics` for entries that pass the address filter. This restores full fidelity for trusted peers on the same network.

### `core/src/transport/swarm.rs`

#### Modified: Exchange Handler (Lines 5668 / 6224)
*   **Context Extraction:** Before calling `exchange_response_entries`, extract the peer's trust level from the store.
    ```rust
    let trust_level = store.get_identity_annotation(&remote_peer_id)
        .map(|a| a.trust_level)
        .unwrap_or(TrustLevel::Untrusted);
    ```
*   **Call Site Update:** Pass `trust_level` to `exchange_response_entries`.
*   **Handshake Completion Hook (Line 3936+):** Ensure the reciprocal exchange trigger includes the resolved identity/trust context. If the handshake completes but identity resolution fails or yields no annotation, default to `Untrusted`.

## 5. Downgrade and Abuse Analysis

| Attack Vector | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Impersonation** | Trust is bound to the Noise static key (NodeID). An attacker cannot impersonate a trusted peer without compromising their long-term signing key. Handshake guarantees key ownership. |
| **Replay of Trust** | Trust annotations include timestamps and are validated against current time. Expired annotations revert to `Untrusted`. |
| **MITM on Pairing Channel** | Pairing occurs over authenticated channels or out-of-band verification. Once written to the ledger, the annotation is immutable and signed. Transport-layer MITM cannot alter stored trust state. |
| **Transitive Trust Leak** | The predicate checks *local* trust state for the *direct* peer. If Node A trusts Node B, and Node B connects to Attacker C, Node B will NOT disclose A's LAN to C unless B also explicitly trusts C. Trust is non-transitive. |
| **Downgrade to Unpaired** | An attacker cannot force a node to "forget" trust annotations via protocol messages. Annotations are removed only by local operator action or expiration. |
| **Topic Correlation** | Topics are only disclosed when addresses are disclosed. Partial information leakage (topics without IPs) is prevented by coupling the filters. |

## 6. Test Plan

### Unit Tests (`core/src/store/ledger_entry.rs`)
1.  `test_exchange_filters_rfc1918_when_untrusted`: Verify existing behavior is preserved.
2.  `test_exchange_includes_rfc1918_when_trusted`: Verify new behavior with valid annotation.
3.  `test_exchange_excludes_rfc1918_when_annotation_expired`: Verify temporal validity.
4.  `test_exchange_includes_topics_when_trusted`: Verify topic un-blanking.
5.  `test_exchange_blanks_topics_when_untrusted`: Verify topic protection remains.

### Integration Tests (`core/src/transport/swarm.rs`)
1.  `test_handshake_with_paired_peer_yields_lan_entries`: End-to-end verification.
2.  `test_handshake_with_unknown_peer_yields_no_lan_entries`: Regression test.
3.  `test_mixed_version_trusted_exchange`: New sender -> Old receiver compatibility.

### Adversarial Regression Suite
*   `exchange_response_never_discloses_private_ranges_to_strangers`: MUST CONTINUE PASSING. This is the primary safety invariant.
*   `ssrf_probe_via_ledger_exchange_rejected`: Verify no private ranges in response to unauthenticated probes.

## 7. Rollout Strategy

### Feature Flag
Introduce `ENABLE_TRUST_SCOPED_LAN_DISCLOSURE` in `core/src/config/flags.rs`.
*   **Default:** OFF for initial merge.
*   **Activation:** Enabled per-deployment after adversarial review.

### Adversarial Review Gate (AGENTS.md Rule 8)
Before enabling by default, the following checklist must be signed off:
*   [ ] Verified that `is_disclosable_multiaddr` override is strictly gated by `TrustLevel::Trusted`.
*   [ ] Confirmed no transitive trust paths exist in the predicate.
*   [ ] Validated that topic disclosure is coupled to address disclosure.
*   [ ] Reviewed all call sites of `exchange_response_entries` for correct trust context propagation.
*   [ ] Penetration test completed simulating compromised trusted peer.

## 8. Open Questions

## 9. Fusion Lite Panel Verification & Multiaddress Routing Isolation

**Panel Execution:** Run cost: `$0.002704` (Ceiling: `$0.02`). Models: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` + `qwen/qwen3-coder-flash` (Judge: `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`). Max Tokens: `4000`. Status: **Complete / Untruncated (`finish_reason: stop`)**. Verdict: **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**.

### Routing Isolation Invariant & Safeguards
Storing RFC 1918 private multiaddrs must **never confuse routing** or cause dial delays when peers roam across different networks (e.g. WAN, cellular, or foreign Wi-Fi).

* **Dial Scoring**: LAN IPv4 / IPv6 ULA receives `Score = 100` (Priority 1) on same subnet. Subnet mismatches on WAN are assigned `Score = 0` (Filtered out / REJECTED) to eliminate TCP timeouts, falling back to Public IPs (`Score = 100`) or Cloud Relay circuits (`Score = 80`).
* **IPv6 Parity**: Rules apply to IPv4 RFC 1918, IPv6 ULA (`fc00::/7`), and IPv6 Link-Local (`fe80::/10`).
* **Noise Authentication**: Requires completed Noise XX static-key verification even on same-subnet LAN disclosures.
* **Multi-Homed Subnet Matching**: `is_same_subnet()` checks target addresses against **all** active bound host interfaces.
* **DHCP IP Flip Protection**: Un-contactable RFC 1918 addresses increment `failure_count` and expire after `LEDGER_DEAD_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` failures to flush stale DHCP records.
